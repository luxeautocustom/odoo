**Instruction video:** `Website Multilingual Multimedia <https://youtu.be/SNeoYC3mcAo>`_

In the process of translating the content of the website, you should put images and videos suitable for the language to be translated. The *viin_website_multilingual_multimedia* application will help you:

**1. Translate the images (by selecting other images while translating the page)**

To `translate the content of the website <https://viindoo.com/documentation/15.0/applications/websites/website/publish/how-to-setup-a-multi-language-website.html#translate-website-contents>`_ and images, you need to change the default language of the website to the language to be translated by hovering the mouse to the bottom of the web page, selecting the language and clicking the **TRANSLATION** button on the top menu bar of the website. You select each image to appear in the **Translate Attribute** window and replace the image by pressing **Select a media** and uploading a new image instead.
